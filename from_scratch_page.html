    <h2>Stevie Ray Vaughan Life Summary</h2>
    <p>"In the early 1960s, Vaughan's admiration for his brother Jimmie resulted in his trying different instruments such as the drums and saxophone.[7][nb 2] In 1961, for his seventh birthday, Vaughan received his first guitar, a toy guitar from Sears with a Western motif.[9][nb 3] Learning by ear he diligently committed himself, following along to songs by the Nightcaps, particularly "Wine, Wine, Wine" and "Thunderbird".[11][nb 4] He listened to blues artists such as Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters, and rock guitarists including Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, as well as jazz guitarists including Kenny Burrell.[13] In 1963, he acquired his first electric guitar, a Gibson ES-125T, as a hand-me-down from Jimmie.[14]

        Soon after he acquired the electric guitar, Vaughan joined his first band, the Chantones, in 1965.[15] Their first show was at a talent contest held in Dallas' Hill Theatre, but after realizing that they could not perform a Jimmy Reed song in its entirety, Vaughan left the band and joined the Brooklyn Underground, playing professionally at local bars and clubs.[15] He received Jimmie's Fender Broadcaster, which he later traded for an Epiphone Riviera.[16] When Jimmie left home at age sixteen, Vaughan's apparent obsession with the guitar caused a lack of support from his parents.[17] Miserable at home, he took a job at a local hamburger stand, where he washed dishes and dumped trash for seventy cents an hour. After falling into a barrel of grease, he grew tired of the job and quit to devote his life to a music career.[18]" (Wikipedia)</p>
